The tutorial is guided by [slides](https://rdf-connect.github.io/Tutorial-SEMANTiCS2025/slides/), which are [shared online](https://rdf-connect.github.io/Tutorial-SEMANTiCS2025/slides/).
For the [hands-on coding sessions](https://github.com/rdf-connect/vienna-weather-forecast-kg-pipeline), we provide a [git repository](https://github.com/rdf-connect/vienna-weather-forecast-kg-pipeline) with separate branches for all sequentially completed tasks.
This will allow participants that are unable to complete a certain task,
to still begin with the next task by checking out the corresponding branch.
An [online specification](https://rdf-connect.github.io/specification/) is provided with detailed technical descriptions.
The slides, specification and git repository are open for everyone under the CC BY 4.0 license.
